# Satisfactory PHP API Client

API client for dedicated Satisfactory servers

This is an initial version, based on the API examples showed in their [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8piXNQwcUw)
It will need some additional tweaking once out, to get it running, for example we will need to know how to get the token etc.
